# ShortestPath
Project for CSCI115 Shortest path given maps that contain different tiles, road, plain, forest mountain Scan in text file, create adjacency matrix based on map, find shortest path given a start and end point File List: dataStructures: folder //contains all the custom made data structures we will be using array: folder //this contains a class for a 2d array that will be used for the maps and andjacency matrix array.h array.cpp graph: folder //adjacency matrix that conatins functions to create a matrix based on the map and shortest path algorithm graph.h graph.cpp priorityQ: folder //for shortest path alg priorityQ.h priorityQ.cpp mapStuff: folder //contain everything related to maps that isn't part of a class mapFuncs: folder mapRead.cpp //function to read in text file and make corresponding 2d matrx printMap.cpp //function to print the map from the 2d array with colors and also to print shortest path maps: folder //holds text files of maps map1.txt map2.txt map3.txt map4.txt map5.txt main.cpp README.md
